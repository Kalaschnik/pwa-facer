## About
This project was part of the class *Knowledge- and Content Management* in the department of *Natural Language Processing*, held by Prof. Dr. Gerhard Heyer & Dr. Thomas Efer.

This project consists of two components. (1) A Progressive Web App, which enables the user to take and store photos (of faces to fulfill the purpose), and (2) the capability to analyze faces in regards to various aspects, such as: *Age, Emotions, Gender, Pose, Smile, and Facial Hair*, etc.

A field of application for this App is to code facial expressions as they may indicate a emotions, such as the seven basic emotion defined by Ekman (i.e., Rage, Anger, Contempt, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Happiness, Sadness and Surprise)[^fn1]. See also Darwin’s *The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals*[^fn2]
